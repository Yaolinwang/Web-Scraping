# Web-Scraping

### This repository contains my Python codes for web-scraping. 

Currently there are 3 files, with these 3 files you can:
1. Web-scrap all companies in a chosen industry.
2. Web-scrap target companies' description.
3. Web-scrap target companies' headquarter geo-location (both latitude and longitude).

### Under developing
Recently I found 13F filling [https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-form13fhtm.html](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-form13fhtm.html) is interesting, which can be used to monitoring hedge funds' positions change and may get some further insight from those fillings. But web-scraping these fillings is a pain. Some companies provide organized 13F fillings. But I decided to do it on my own.
